Each Lab references the Network Data folder. Each lab is an RMD file with an acccompanying PDF so it can be read without running the code.

Lab 3 focuses on basic network construction and plotting. 

Lab 4 looks at different measures of centrality.

Lab 5 examines the density of a network and runs a Conditional Uniform Graph Test.

Lab 6 figures out how many communities there are and who is in each community. 

Lab 7 runs a random intercept model, which looks at how the types of nodes and relationships can predict a connection's strength.

Lab 8 looks at how a model can predict a network. 

Lab 9 goes over the epimodel package and examines how an epidemic would spread over a network. 

Lab 10 determines how likely nodes are to adopt something based on how their neighbors have adopted.
