These are all my assignments from my introductory SQL course. 

Homework #1 involves gathering basic information: the names of company positions, the number of managers, their birthdays, and how long they have worked for the company. 

Homework #2 focuses on using case statements and temporary tables to get specific information about different regions in a company's sales territory. 

Homework #3 works on getting financial information about sales performances: the number of goods sold, the unit prices, and total sales for a region.

Homework #4 was mainly about joining tables and then grouping them by region or product to find out specific information about various sales.

The Familiarization assignment served as my introduction to SQL. 

The AdventureWorks schema was the database used for the assignment. 

The database creation assignment was the construction of a basic database for a homework.
